  <p>DENMARK
    GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE COUNTRY AND PEOPLE.
    Denmark Proper is but a small state, including the peninsula of Jutland and the islands of the Cattegat, and those of the southern and western parts of the Baltic, to which is attached the dukedoms of Sleswick, Holstein, Oldenburg and Lauenburg, the most of whose inhabitants use the German language. Her foreign dependencies, like those of Great Britain, are far more extensive than her home dominions. These have their peculiar dialects, and use the Danish language only in part, chiefly in public affairs and business transactions, and even her home provinces and islands have great dialectic peculiarities, to a considerable extent unintelligible to each other. But the literature of Copenhagen is the regular and standard language, if in truth it can be said to have a standard. But the language, like the people, is so surrounded and intermixed with others, that changes and improvements are very considerable, and its laws quite unsettled.
    
    In the State of Norway, the Danish language is spoken and written generally and taught in her schools. And although they maintain their rustic dialects, it is doubted if the old Norsk language has been used in printing since the days of the Reformation.
    
    Iceland, probably, possesses quite as many associations of interest to the Danes as any other of their foreign dependencies. In my interviews with Professor Repp, he frequently took occasion to refer, with apparent pride and satisfaction, to his native Iceland, as the nursery of literature and keeper of the Danish records, during the barbarous and demoralizing wars that swept over Scandinavia. They still maintain their own literature, and have a translation of the Scriptures, but as their priests are educated in Copenhagen, and their merchants mostly Danish, the national religion, policy and impress of Denmark is stamped upon them as upon her other provinces. At present, with a territory larger than Denmark Proper, Iceland only numbers about sixty thousand inhabitants.
    
    Denmark Proper is about in the latitude of Scotland, and has a climate somewhat similar. Unlike the cold mountainous regions of Norway and Sweden, it lies low, and by being to such an extent surrounded by water and interspersed with small lakes, preserves an equilibrium of temperature beyond what its latitude might otherwise indicate. Though it is sometimes visited with heavy falls of snow, and the severity of winter has congealed the salt water of the Belts and the sound, so that teams have crossed the ice between Denmark and Sweden. The islands, particularly Zealand and Fuen, the two largest, are rich and in a high state of cultivation. The country generally is poorly supplied with highways, and I sometimes found myself wandering from house to house and from village to village, through bye roads and footpaths, crossing sluiceways on a plank or pole, and at wet seasons, when the country was nearly half covered with water, obliged to wade through mud and water, or take a serpentine route through fields.
    
    The country people, generally, live in small villages, miserable houses, with thatched roofs and clay floors, and are generally filthy and uncouth in their habits. In the large towns a degree of order and neatness is exhibited, and urbanity of manners, such as is common to English towns. Nearly every village, however insignificant, has its Church, and priest to receive their tithings, and attend to their spiritual wants. With regard to improvements, the Danes are sadly deficient in means or enterprise, probably both. They have but one piece of railroad, sixteen miles in length, from Copenhagen to a neighbouring town. The capital itself is still lighted with the old oil lamps, and the fire companies haul their hose and water on sheds with tubs and barrels. A telegraph is unknown in the country. The navy yard and fixtures, fortifications, public buildings, walks and gardens, of Copenhagen, would be a credit to any town or nation. The priests are often to be seen in the streets with their black gowns and white ruffles.

        COFFEE—I.
        As Prepared By Maria Parloa.
        I
        IN war times, after a battle or a long march, how the soldiers enjoyed their coffee! And in many cases it was pretty poor coffee, too, though to them it seemed fit for the gods. The delicious aroma which arose made their feelings of weariness or depression vanish for a while, and the beverage itself cheered them in a marked degree. Nothing could take its place; nothing can take its place to-day. The consumption of coffee in this country is enormous. Rich and poor alike must have it. But it is a common complaint that a cup of good coffee is the exception rather than the rule. Considering the low price of the raw material, this should not be the case. People are prone to think that they know all there is to be known about coffee, and do not take pains to learn what special qualities different brands possess, and what the most approved modes of making coffee are.
        
        Time was when a Mexican or South or Central American coffee was considered an inferior article. To-day some of the best coffees come from these places. For example, one of the[6] most delicious coffees which is brought into this country comes from Guatemala. It bears the name of "Las Nubes" (The Clouds), which it takes from the plantation where it is grown. There is an odd bit of history connected with this plantation. A Scotchman named Nelson owned it, and was coining money from it, when he was banished from the country by President Barrios, and his property was confiscated. It is now owned by the widow of Barrios. The annual yield from it is four hundred and fifty thousand pounds. A large proportion of this goes to England, where it brings a higher price than here.
        
        There are two kinds of coffee,—the strong and the mild. To the first class belong the Rio and Santas, and to the second, the Java, Mocha, Maracaibo, and, indeed, almost all the other kinds. When a rich, smooth beverage is desired, a combination of Mocha and Java—or some coffee that has the qualities of Java—should be used; but when a very strong flavor is liked, Rio or Santas should be taken. The supply of Java meets only about one-fifth of the demand. For this reason many other mild coffees are sold under the name of "Java." Good Maracaibo is equal to Java, and is constantly sold under that name. A combination of one pound Mocha, one pound Rio, and two pounds Java or Maracaibo will give a rich, strong-flavored drink, but not so smooth as if the Rio were omitted.
        
        When buying the berry, pause for a moment to think how you like your beverage. Do you want it smooth and of delicate flavor? Take one-third Mocha and the rest Java or Maracaibo. Do you want it strong? Use all Rio, or temper that brand by combining it with some one of the mild kinds.

        A large proportion of housekeepers buy their coffee roasted, and many also buy it ground. If coffee, while still hot from the roaster, were put into vessels almost air tight, and kept in them until ground for use, the improvement in the drink made from it would amply repay for the trouble taken. Much of the fine aroma is lost before the roasted bean reaches the housekeeper, and there is even a greater loss if the coffee has been ground for a considerable time. These are some of the disadvantages which must be endured when one buys coffee already roasted. But, on the other hand, unless the roasting be done very carefully, the coffee will not be good. A few burnt beans in a quart will ruin the drink. When careful attention to roasting cannot be given at home, it will be better to buy a supply already roasted, but never ground. A French small mill, which can be regulated to grind coarse or fine, can be bought for about a dollar and a half. With care it will last for ten or twenty years. Some firms put up coffee in tin cans. It costs more, but retains so much of the aroma as to be well worth the extra price.
        
        When green coffee is bought, be careful that it is well seasoned. It should have a brownish or yellowish tint, which comes only with years of seasoning. The best way to do, when it is possible, is to buy green coffee by the sack, and keep it stored in a sweet, dry place—say the attic—for two or three years. In that time it will have become sufficiently mellowed.
        
        To roast coffee, put the green beans into a large dripping-pan, being sure that the pan is perfectly clean. Have the coffee about an inch deep. Place the pan in a moderate oven. Stir frequently, and at the end of half an hour increase the heat of[8] the oven. From this time until the beans are sufficiently browned, there should be a stirring every three or four minutes. When the coffee is almost a chestnut color, remove the pan from the oven, and for every quart add one tablespoonful of butter. Stir well; and, while the coffee is still hot, put it into cans and cover closely. Coffee absorbs moisture and odors. It should therefore be kept in a sweet, dry place.
        
        There are so many ways of making coffee, and so many kinds of coffee-pots, that young housekeepers often are perplexed in choosing either a mode of preparing the drink or a utensil in which to make it. If a few principles be carefully observed, a perfect result may be counted as a certainty—provided, of course, that the ground coffee be good. The berries should be heated before or after grinding. The coffee-pot should be entirely clean, without a particle of old coffee grounds in it. The coffee should not be subjected to long boiling, as this will dissipate the aroma and produce a rather bitter drink. Coffee that is not boiled at all is very smooth and free of bitter flavor. All coffee should be served hot, and as soon as possible after being made. Always serve cream or hot milk with it. Heat the milk to the boiling point, but do not let it boil.
        
        Tastes vary as to the proper strength of coffee. The rules given in this article are for a strong drink; and where only moderate strength is desired, use but half the quantity of dry coffee for the quantity of water stated. Coffee made with cold water always is stronger than that made with boiling water, and in the opinion of many people it is better; but some folks think that no coffee is equal to that which has been boiled with an egg. No matter what mode of making the drink is followed,[9] the result will be pleasing if good material is used, the work done quickly, and the coffee served fresh and hot.
        
        Here are four rules, any one of which will give perfect coffee, but each of a different flavor:—
